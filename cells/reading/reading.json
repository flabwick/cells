Note striking facts, unexpected claims and unique perspectives.

      "text": "CONTENT: [[1]]\n\n**1. Identify Value-Bearing Units (VBUs)**\nScan the text for atomic elements that hold value across dimensions:\n\n* **Declarative Knowledge** → facts, definitions, core assertions (IV)\n* **Conceptual Models** → frameworks, diagrams, taxonomies (CV, PV)\n* **Procedural Steps** → methods, checklists, algorithms (PV)\n* **Causal Chains** → explanations, mechanisms, if-then structures (CV)\n* **Transformative Claims** → surprising insights, reframings (AfV, CV)\n* **Credibility Anchors** → sources, qualifiers, caveats (ETV)\n* **Navigational Signposts** → transitions, objectives, summaries (SV)\n\nThese units may span sentences or paragraphs. Extract them directly, discarding connective filler.\n\n---\n\n**2. Quantify Each VBU by Value Dimensions**\nFor each unit, assign latent scores:\n\n* **IV:** Is this new, accurate, and generalizable information?\n* **CV:** Does it enhance models, deepen understanding, or enable reasoning?\n* **PV:** Is it directly applicable or translatable to real-world contexts?\n* **AfV:** Does it motivate, clarify purpose, or shift perspective?\n* **ETV:** Is it well-sourced, qualified, or transparently reasoned?\n* **SV:** Is it structurally important for orienting the reader?\n\nThis enables filtering and prioritizing VBUs that carry the most transferable value.\n\n---\n\n**3. Compress by Value Density**\nPreserve units with highest multi-dimensional value. Criteria:\n\n* Maximize cross-dimensional density (e.g., a single sentence that informs, explains, and motivates).\n* Prefer synthesis over repetition.\n* Preserve *generative concepts*—those that unlock understanding of many other parts.\n\nDiscard or abstract low-density, low-transfer VBUs (e.g., excessive anecdotes, low-relevance detail).\n\n---\n\n**4. Reconstruct Value-Equivalent Summary**\nGenerate a document that:\n\n* Rebuilds conceptual structure using high-density VBUs.\n* States core assertions, models, and procedures clearly and sequentially.\n* Incorporates brief framing (intro, transitions) only to restore coherence.\n* Preserves logical flow, not literal sequence.\n* Uses reformulated language optimized for clarity and concision.\n\nTarget: maximum retained value ÷ minimum length.\n\n---\n\n**5. Evaluate by Reconstructed Value Profile**\nScore final document using theoretical dimensions (Bloom, RST, Grice, Relevance Theory):\n\n* Is it cognitively challenging and structurally coherent?\n* Does it maintain credible and actionable insight?\n* Is emotional clarity and motivation preserved where essential?\n\nIf scores approximate those of the original (or better per word), the condensation succeeds.\n\n\nRESPOND IN A LONG 1000-WORD PASSAGE. Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print. Never use a long word where a short one will do.\n\nNever use the passive where you can use the active.\n\nNever use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.\n\nDON'T DO ANY CODING OR SEARCHING, JUST WRITE IN THE CHAT."
