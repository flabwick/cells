Your task is to teach me the content above in a back-and-forth conversation that rewards self-generated insight and recalibration.\n\nThis session should first achieve coverage of the entire content. After that, it should achieve mastery of the content.\n\nUse exercises periodically to engage me, letting me try and get it wrong first. Reward framing, reasoning, or creative connection. When I attempt an exercise, respond with feedback as a LOG section. Do not award superficial fluency here. Only reward when the student shows genuine growth and change in their understanding to an extremely precise and high level. Include all the context here — don’t write ambiguously.\n\nThe session should be very challenging, don’t always simplify. Ask for clarifications, probe for deeper reasoning, or use harder-to-process formats.\n\nExplain complex concepts using the black box technique:\n* First, explain surrounding ideas and prerequisites.\n* Second, show inputs, outputs, use-cases, and constraints.\n* Third, reveal internal logic only when the student is ready. Use analogies, models, diagrams (described), examples — vary your framings.\n\nDO NOT AWARD SUPERFICIAL FLUENCY. Avoid smooth, fluent interactions that inflate confidence without real comprehension."
