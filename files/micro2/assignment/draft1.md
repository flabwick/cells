**Executive Summary** 

The Guardian article reports on the U.S. removal of the de-minimis tariff exemption, forecasting higher prices on fast fashion imports from platforms like Shein and Temu. It suggests these price hikes may shift consumer demand and force firms to adapt their supply chains. This report agrees with the basic premise but critiques the article’s lack of analytical depth. By drawing on intermediate microeconomics, it shows that consumer responsiveness depends on the elasticity of demand—likely high in fast fashion—making quantity effects potentially large even from small price shifts. Simultaneously, empirical and theoretical models show that firms may strategically respond not by absorbing costs but by re-optimizing inventory, altering production structures, or reshaping pricing strategies. Finally, the report evaluates whether the policy enhances welfare or introduces inefficiencies by examining deadweight loss, distributional impacts, and potential positive externalities from resale markets. Through a structured application of tax incidence, firm behavior models, and welfare theory, this report reveals that the true economic consequences are more complex—and more revealing—than the media portrayal suggests.

**Introduction**

The termination of the U.S. de-minimis exemption represents a significant policy intervention with wide-reaching implications for the fast fashion ecosystem. At face value, it imposes tariffs on low-value imports, targeting platforms like Shein and Temu. However, its deeper consequences lie in how it reshapes incentives across consumers and firms, redistributes market power, and challenges the efficiency of global supply chains. The Guardian article anticipates price hikes and possible shifts in consumer and firm behavior but stops short of analyzing how these changes unfold through core economic mechanisms. This report bridges that gap by applying microeconomic tools—elasticity, marginal analysis, and welfare evaluation—to dissect the policy’s likely outcomes. Section 1 examines consumer responses using demand elasticity and incidence models; Section 2 explores firm adaptations through cost-pass-through and strategic reoptimization frameworks; and Section 3 assesses the policy’s normative justification through welfare and efficiency analysis. The aim is to provide a rigorous, evidence-backed critique that moves beyond surface-level commentary to economic insight.


**CONSUMER RESPONSES**


The Guardan article argues that the end of the de-minimis rule and increased tariffs on Chinese imports will raise prices and shift demand away from firms like Shein and Temu. While this outcome is plausible, the article overlooks key economic mechanisms like the elasticity of demand, the distribution of the tax incidence and consequences that it has on welfare. Using intermediate microeconomic theory—particularly elasticity, tax incidence, and consumer optimization—it becomes clear that the policy’s effects are far more complex than suggested. Reality is a lot more complex than just tariffs = higher prices, the behaviour of firms and consumers is shaped by these complex economic processes.

Price elasticity of demand is the most significant factor that is ignored by the article. Fast fashion goods typically face elastic demand because they are cheap, easily substituted and non-essential goods. Consumers of fast fashion are also often strategic with their purchases, anticipating markdowns in prices (Aviv et al. (2019)) The more elastic the demand, the more sensitive consumers are to price changes, which means that even modest tariffs can significantly reduce the quantity demanded, supporting the articles claims.

The article seems to imply this assumption, but we cannot just assume elastic goods in all cases. Certain ultra-low price fast fashion goods may show inelastic demand in some cases. When items are priced near marginal cost—such as $5 crop tops or $3 accessories— consumers may be less influenced by price changes in absolute terms, even if they appear large by magnitude since the price of the good is already so low.

It's also important to consider the substitution and income effects when discussing consumer behaviour. Tariffs shift the consumer's budget constraint and prompts them to re-optimise their bundles. If the substitution effect is dominant, then consumers will shift towards alternatives unaffected by the tariffs, like secondhand or domestic clothes. If the income effect is dominant, then the response depends on whether the goods are seen as necessities, luxuries or inferior.  Defining this is difficult, since on one end clothes are a necessity, but fast fashion clothes specifically may be inferior goods to some low-income consumers. However, the price change is small relative to the total income of most consumers, so the substitution effect is likely dominant in this case. This only works on the assumption that fast fashion clothes have close substitutes which are easily switched to - an assumption that may also not be entirely true.

Ultimately, the article’s oversimplification of the tariff-price relationship neglects how nuanced consumer behavior can be under changing market conditions. Whether consumers switch away from fast fashion depends not only on price increases but also on how they perceive the value and substitutability of these goods. By failing to incorporate these microeconomic mechanisms—elasticity, tax incidence, and consumer re-optimization—the article misses the more complex and layered reality of how tariffs might reshape demand.

**Firm Behavior: Cost Shock and Strategic Response**
The article implies that firms operate under perfect competition by assuming that tariffs will lead to straightforward price increases. But in this case, firms like Shein and Temu occupy an industry that's closer to monopolistic competition than that. This alters the way we predict behaviour, since monopolistic firms tend to act strategically, and they may not simply pass costs on to consumers the way a perfect competition situation might.

For instance, they may absorb tariffs on popular items, possibly making a loss, to maintain user traffic, while they raise prices on more inelastic goods to compensate.

It's also important to consider the difference between monopolistic competition in a traditional sense and monopolistic competition in a digital context. Digital retailers can exploit algorithmic pricing, where they can shift cost burdens real-time based on changing elasticities. When elasticity is low, the platform can focus price hikes and adjust real time.

Additionally, the platform-driven nature of fast fashion means that economies of scale is a big part of the decision-making process. As Shein’s user base grows, its recommendation system improves, reducing marginal costs as the selling pipeline becomes more efficient and optimal. App downloads and user ship is another thing that shein and Temu have accumulated over time and leads to a feedback loop of more advertising and more purchasing as consumers scroll the apps more and more. Smaller rivals are unable to match this scalability, and in a digital platform-driven space, this is really important. This would actually consolidate Shein and Temu's positions in the market despite the tariffs.

The article also implies that in the fast-fashion space, price is the main driver in demand. This is a simplistic view and ignores other ways consumers derive utility from fast fashion such as perceived uniqueness and process utility. Fashion buyers don't just want cheap clothes, they want something new and different each time. The sheer scale of production allows fast-fashion platforms to show thousands of different styles that are constantly changing. (put research in here, shein production being much bigger and more variety than others. Domestic competitors and secondhand chains may not be able to match the novelty of fast-fashion and will keep it desirable despite the tariffs.

Also, consumers derive utility from the process of using the fast-fashion platforms and the value users place on the shopping experience itself. Features like rewards, flash sales and gamified parts of the app make the experience of scrolling the apps enjoyable in a way that's difficult to replicate as a smaller competitor.

In short, firm responses to tariffs are far from mechanical. Intermediate microeconomics reveals pricing strategies, platform-specific advantages, and consumer behaviors that complicate the narrative presented in the article.


**Government Intervention: Efficiency, Distortion, or Correction?**

The Guardian article asserts that eliminating the de-minimis rule corrects a competitive imbalance favoring fast fashion retailers such as Shein and Temu. However, from an intermediate microeconomic standpoint, this intervention raises important questions regarding market efficiency, consumer welfare, and unintended distortions.

Firstly, the effectiveness of tariffs as corrective measures depends fundamentally on whether a genuine market failure exists. The article presupposes unfair competition arising from tax advantages without adequately analyzing if such asymmetry truly constitutes market distortion. Indeed, introducing tariffs creates a price wedge and consequently a deadweight loss (DWL), reducing allocative efficiency (Module 14). Given the documented high price elasticity for fast fashion goods (Andrews and Benzing, 2010), the economic incidence of tariffs likely falls heavily on consumers rather than producers, disproportionately affecting lower-income individuals dependent on affordable clothing.

Further complicating the article's claims, empirical studies by Miravete (2024) indicate that uniform price constraints—comparable to tariffs enforcing uniform cost increases—often reduce overall welfare and output compared to flexible pricing models. This suggests that imposing tariffs may unintentionally diminish consumer welfare more broadly, undermining rather than supporting fairness objectives.

Additionally, operational adaptability within firms is a critical consideration overlooked in the original article. Fares et al. (2018) demonstrate that retailers often respond to cost pressures by optimising inventory management and supply-chain responsiveness, potentially offsetting tariff impacts without substantially changing their business practices. Such firm-level strategies imply tariffs alone may fail to shift consumer behaviors towards sustainable options like resale platforms, contrary to the article’s optimistic claims.

Finally, theoretical insights from Aviv et al. (2019) highlight strategic consumer behaviors, such as delaying purchases in anticipation of price fluctuations, complicating simplistic assumptions about direct demand responses. The implication here is that tariffs may not straightforwardly achieve intended consumption reductions or sustainability goals but could instead induce complex, unpredictable market dynamics.

In sum, while the removal of the de-minimis rule seeks fairness in market competition, economic theory and empirical evidence suggest it is likely to introduce inefficiencies and unintended distortions. More targeted, precise interventions directly addressing specific market failures, such as environmental externalities, would be preferable to generalized tariff measures with uncertain welfare outcomes.
