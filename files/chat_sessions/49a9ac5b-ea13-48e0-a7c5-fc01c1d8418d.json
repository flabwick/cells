BENJAMIN FRANKLIN  Love is an ideal thing, marriage a real thing; a confusion of the real with the ideal never goes unpunished.  JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE  When Albert Einstein proclaimed that E=mc2, no physicists asked each other, \u201cWhat\u2019s he mean by E?\u201d In the hard sciences, the important stuff comes packaged in numbers and predefined symbols. Imprecise wording rarely causes confusion. But in more interpretive sciences such as anthropology, psychology, and evolutionary theory, misinterpretation and misunderstanding are common.  Take the words love and lust, for example. Love and lust are as different from each other as red wine and blue cheese, but because they can also complement one another splendidly, they get conflated with amazing, dumbfounding regularity.  In the literature of evolutionary psychology, in popular culture, in the tastefully appointed offices of marriage counselors, in religious teachings, in political discourse, and in our own mixed-up lives, lust is often mistaken for love. Perhaps even more insidious and damaging in societies insistent on long-term, sexually exclusive monogamy, the negative form of that statement is also true. The absence of lust is misread as indicating an absence of love (we\u2019ll explore this in Part V).  Experts inadvertently encourage us to confuse the two. Helen Fisher\u2019s Anatomy of Love, a book referenced earlier, is far more concerned with shared parental responsibility for a child\u2019s first few years than with the love joining the parents to one another. But we can\u2019t blame Fisher, as the language itself works against clarity. We can \u201csleep with\u201d someone without ever closing our eyes.1 When we read that the politician \u201cmade love\u201d with the prostitute, we know love had little to do with it. When we report how many \u201clovers\u201d we\u2019ve had, are we claiming to have been \u201cin love\u201d with all of them? Similarly, if we \u201cmate\u201d with someone, does that make us \u201cmates\u201d? Show a guy a photo of a hot-looking woman and ask him if he\u2019d like to \u201cmate with her.\u201d Chances are good he\u2019ll say (or think), \u201cSure!\u201d But chances are also high that marriage, children, and the prospect of a long future together never entered into his decision-making process.  Everyone knows these are arbitrary expressions for an almost infinite range of situations and relationships\u2014everyone, it appears, but the experts. Many evolutionary psychologists and other researchers seem to think that \u201clove\u201d and \u201csex\u201d are interchangeable terms. And they throw together \u201ccopulating\u201d and \u201cmating\u201d as well. This failure to define terminology often leads to confusion and allows cultural bias to contaminate our thinking about human sexual nature. Let\u2019s try to hack a path through this tangled verbal undergrowth.  Marriage: The \u201cFundamental Condition\u201d of the Human Species?  The intimate male-female relationship\u2026which zoologists have dubbed a \u2018pair bond,\u2019 is bred into our bones. I believe this is what sets us apart from the apes more than anything else.  FRANS DE WAAL2  The majority of husbands remind me of an orangutan trying to play the violin.  HONOR\u00c9 DE BALZAC  The holy grail of evolutionary psychology is the \u201chuman universal.\u201d The whole point of the discipline is to tease out intrinsically human patterns of perception, cognition, and behavior from those determined on a cultural or personal level: Do you like baseball because you grew up watching games with Dad or because the sight of small groups of men strategizing and working together on a field connects to a primordial module in your brain? That\u2019s the sort of question evolutionary psychologists love to ask and aspire to answer.  Because evolutionary psychology is all about uncovering and elucidating the so-called psychic unity of humankind\u2014and because of the considerable political and professional pressure to discover traits that conform to specific political agendas\u2014readers need to be cautious about claims concerning such universals. Too often, the claims don\u2019t hold up to scrutiny.  The supposed universality of human marriage\u2014and the linked omnipresence of the nuclear family\u2014is a case in point. A cornerstone of the standard model of human sexual evolution, the claim for this universal human tendency to marry appears to be beyond question or doubt\u2014\u201cunquestioningly correct\u201d in Malinowski\u2019s words. Though the tendency has been assumed since before Darwin, evolutionary biologist Robert Trivers\u2019s now-classic paper Parental Investment and Sexual Selection, published in 1972, consolidated the position of marriage as foundational to most theories of human sexual evolution.3  Recall that marriage, as defined by these theories, represents the fundamental exchange underlying human sexual evolution. In his BBC television series The Human Animal, Desmond Morris flatly declares, \u201cThe pair bond is the fundamental condition of the human species.\u201d Michael Ghiglieri, biologist and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Jane Goodall, writes, \u201cMarriage\u2026is the ultimate human contract. Men and women in all societies marry in nearly the same way. Marriage,\u201d continues Ghiglieri, \u201cis normally a \u2018permanent\u2019 mating between a man and a woman\u2026with the woman nurturing the infants, while the man supports and defends them. The institution of marriage,\u201d he concludes, \u201cis older than states, churches, and laws.\u201d4 Oh my. The fundamental condition? The ultimate human contract? Hard to argue with that.  But let\u2019s try, because slippery use of the word marriage in the anthropological literature has resulted in a huge headache for anyone trying to understand how marriage and the nuclear family really fit into human nature\u2014if at all. The word, we\u2019ll find, is used to refer to a whole slew of different relationships.  In Female Choices, her survey of female primate sexuality, primatologist Meredith Small writes of the confusion that resulted when the term consortship drifted away from its original meaning\u2014a striking parallel to the confusion over marriage. Small explains, \u201cThe word \u2018consortship\u2019 was used initially to define the close male-female sexual bond seen in savannah baboons and then usage of the word spread to the relationship of other mating pairs.\u201d This semantic leap, says Small, was a mistake. \u201cResearchers began to think that all primates form consortships, and they applied the word to any short or long, exclusive or nonexclusive mating.\u201d This is a problem because \u201cwhat was originally intended to describe a specific male-female association that lasted during the days surrounding ovulation became an all-inclusive word for mating\u2026. Once a female is described as \u2018being in consort,\u2019 no one sees the importance of her regular copulations with other males.\u201d5  Biologist Joan Roughgarden has noted the same problematic application of present-day human mating ideals to animals. She writes, \u201cSexual selection\u2019s primary literature describes extrapair parentage as \u2018cheating\u2019 on the pair bond; the male is said to be \u2018cuckolded\u2019; offspring of extrapair parentage are said to be \u2018illegitimate\u2019; and females who do not participate in extrapair copulations are said to be \u2018faithful.\u2019 This judgmental terminology,\u201d concludes Roughgarden, \u201camounts to applying a contemporary definition of Western marriage to animals.\u201d6  Indeed, when familiar labels are applied, supporting evidence becomes far more visible than counter-evidence in a psychological process known as confirmation bias. Once we have a mental model, we\u2019re much more likely to notice and recall evidence supporting our model than evidence against it. Contemporary medical researchers attempt to neutralize this effect by using double-blind methodology in all serious research\u2014where neither the researcher nor the subject knows which pills contain the real medicine.  Without a clear definition of what they\u2019re looking for, many anthropologists have found marriage wherever they\u2019ve looked. George Murdock, a central figure in American anthropology, asserted in his classic cross-cultural anthropological survey that the nuclear family is a \u201cuniversal human social grouping.\u201d He went on to declare that marriage is found in every human society.  But as we\u2019ve seen, researchers trying to describe human nature are highly susceptible to Flintstonization: unconsciously tending to \u201cdiscover\u201d features that look familiar, and thereby universalizing contemporary social configurations while inadvertently blocking insight into the truth. Journalist Louis Menand noted this tendency in a piece in The New Yorker, writing, \u201cThe sciences of human nature tend to validate the practices and preferences of whatever regime happens to be sponsoring them. In totalitarian regimes, dissidence is treated as a mental illness. In apartheid regimes, interracial contact is treated as unnatural. In free-market regimes, self-interest is treated as hardwired.\u201d7 Paradoxically, in each of these cases, so-called natural behavior has to be encouraged and unnatural aberrations punished.  The now-forgotten diseases drapetomania and dysaethesia aethiopica illustrate this point. Both were described in 1851 by Dr. Samuel Cartwright, a leading authority on the medical care of \u201cNegroes\u201d in Louisiana and a leading thinker in the pro-slavery movement. In his article \u201cDiseases and Peculiarities of the Negro Race,\u201d Dr. Cartwright explained that drapetomania was the disease \u201ccausing Negroes to run away\u2026the absconding from service\u201d to their white owners, while dysaethesia aethiopica was characterized by \u201chebetude of and obtuse sensibility of the body.\u201d He noted that slave overseers often referred to this disease, more simply, as \u201crascality.\u201d8  Despite high-minded claims to the contrary\u2014often couched in language chosen to intimidate would-be dissenters (dysaethesia aethiopica!)\u2014science all too often grovels at the feet of the dominant cultural paradigm.  Another weakness of many of these studies is known as the \u201ctranslation paradox:\u201d the assumption that a word (marriage, for instance) translated from one language to another has an identical meaning.  We can agree that birds sing and bees dance only as long as we remember that their singing and dancing has almost nothing in common with ours\u2014from motivation to execution. We use identical words to signify very different behaviors. It\u2019s the same with marriage.  People everywhere do pair off\u2014even if just for a few hours, days, or years. Maybe they do it to share pleasure, to make babies, to please their families, to seal a political alliance or business deal, or just because they like each other. When they do, the resident anthropologist standing in the shadows of love says, \u201cAha, this culture practices marriage, too. It\u2019s universal!\u201d But many of these relationships are as far from our sense of marriage as a string hammock is from Grandma\u2019s featherbed. Simply changing the jargon and referring to long-term pair bond rather than marriage is no better. As Donald Symons put it, \u201cThe lexicon of the English language is woefully inadequate to reflect accurately the texture of human experience\u2026. To shrink the present vocabulary to one phrase\u2014pair-bond\u2014and to imagine that in so doing one is being scientific\u2026is simply to delude oneself.\u201d9  On Matrimonial Whoredom  Even if we overlook the ubiquitous linguistic confusion, people who consider themselves to be married can have strikingly different notions of what their marriage involves. The Ach\u00e9 of Paraguay say that a man and woman sleeping in the same hut are married. But if one of them takes his or her hammock to another hut, they\u2019re not married anymore. That\u2019s it. The original no-fault divorce.  Among the !Kung San (also known as Ju/\u2019hoansi) of Botswana, most girls marry several times before they settle into a long-term relationship. For the Curripaco of Brazil, marriage is a gradual, undefined process. One scientist who lived with them explains, \u201cWhen a woman comes to hang her hammock next to her man and cook for him, then some younger Curripaco say they are married (kainukana). But older informants disagree; they say they are married only when they have demonstrated that they can support and sustain each other. Having a baby, and going through the fast together, cements a marriage.\u201d10  In contemporary Saudi Arabia and Egypt, there is a form of marriage known as Nikah Misyar (normally translated as \u201ctraveler\u2019s marriage\u201d). According to a recent article from Reuters:  Misyar appeals to men of reduced means, as well as men looking for a flexible arrangement\u2014the husband can walk away from a misyar and can marry other women without informing his first wife. Wealthy Muslims sometimes contract misyar when on holiday to allow them to have sexual relations without breaching the tenets of their faith. Suhaila Zein al-Abideen, of the International Union of Muslim Scholars in Medina, said almost 80 percent of misyar marriages end in divorce. \u201cA woman loses all her rights. Even how often she sees her husband is decided by his moods,\u201d she said.11  In the Shia Muslim tradition, there is a similar institution called Nikah Mut\u2019ah (\u201cmarriage for pleasure\u201d), in which the relationship is entered into with a preordained termination point, like a car rental. These marriages can last anywhere from a few minutes to several years. A man can have any number of temporary wives at the same time (in addition to his \u201cpermanent wife\u201d). Often used as a religious loophole in which prostitution or casual sex can fall within the bounds of religious requirements, there is no paperwork or ceremony required. Is this, too, marriage?  Apart from expectations of permanence or social recognition, what about virginity and sexual fidelity? Are they universal and integral parts of marriage, as parental investment theory would predict? No. For many societies, virginity is so unimportant there isn\u2019t even a word for the concept in their language. Among the Canela, explain Crocker and Crocker, \u201cVirginity loss is only the first step into full marriage for a woman.\u201d There are several other steps needed before the Canela society considers a couple to by truly married, including the young woman\u2019s gaining social acceptance through her service in a \u201cfestival men\u2019s society.\u201d This premarital \u201cservice\u201d includes sequential sex with fifteen to twenty men. If the bride-to-be does well, she\u2019ll earn payments of meat from the men, which will be paid directly to her future mother-in-law on a festival day.  Cacilda Jeth\u00e1 (coauthor of this book) conducted a World Health Organization study of sexual behavior among villagers in rural Mozambique in 1990. She found that the 140 men in her study group were involved with 87 women as wives, 252 other women as long-term sexual partners, and 226 additional women on an occasional basis, working out to an average of four ongoing sexual relationships per man, not counting the unreported casual encounters many of these men likely experienced as well.  Among the Warao, a group living in the forests of Brazil, ordinary relations are suspended periodically and replaced by ritual relations, known as mamuse. During these festivities, adults are free to have sex with whomever they like. These relationships are honorable and believed to have a positive effect upon any children that might result.  In his fascinating profile of the Pirah\u00e3 and a scientist who studies them, journalist John Colapinto reports that \u201cthough [they] do not allow marriage outside their tribe, they have long kept their gene pool refreshed by permitting their women to sleep with outsiders.\u201d12  Among the Siriono, it\u2019s common for brothers to marry sisters, forming an altogether different sort of Brady Bunch. The marriage itself takes place without any sort of ceremony or ritual: no exchanges of property or vows, not even a feast. Just rehang your hammocks next to the women\u2019s and you\u2019re married, boys.  This casual approach to what anthropologists call \u201cmarriage\u201d is anything but unusual. Early explorers, whalers, and fur trappers of the frigid north found the Inuit to be jaw-droppingly hospitable hosts. Imagine their confused gratitude when they realized the village head-man was offering his own bed (wife included) to the weary, freezing traveler. In fact, the welcome Knud Rasmussen and others had stumbled into was a system of spouse exchange central to Inuit culture, with clear advantages in that unforgiving climate. Erotic exchange played an important role in linking families from distant villages in a durable web of certain aid in times of crisis. Though the harsh ecology of the Arctic dictated a much lower population density than the Amazon or even the Kalahari Desert, extra-pair sexual interaction helped cement bonds that offered the same insurance against unforeseen difficulties.  None of this behavior is considered adultery by the people involved. But then, adultery is as slippery a term as marriage. It\u2019s not just thy neighbor\u2019s wife who can lead a man astray, but thine own as well. A well-known moral guide of the Middle Ages, the Speculum Doctrinale (Mirror of Doctrine), written by Vincent of Beauvais, declared, \u201cA man who loves his wife very much is an adulterer. Any love for someone else\u2019s wife, or too much love for one\u2019s own, is shameful.\u201d The author went on to advise, \u201cThe upright man should love his wife with his judgment, not his affections.\u201d13 Vincent of Beauvais would have enjoyed the company of Daniel Defoe (of London), famous still as the author of Robinson Crusoe. Defoe scandalized Britain in 1727 with the publication of a nonfiction essay with the catchy title Conjugal Lewdness: or, Matrimonial Whoredom. Apparently that title was a bit much. For a later edition, he toned it down to A Treatise Concerning the Use and Abuse of the Marriage Bed. This was no desert island adventure but a moralizing lecture on the physical and spiritual dangers of enjoying sex with one\u2019s spouse.  Defoe would have appreciated the Nayar people, native to southern India, who have a type of marriage that doesn\u2019t necessarily include any sexual activity at all, has no expectation of permanence, and no cohabitation\u2014indeed the bride may never see the groom again once the marriage ritual has been performed. But since divorce is not permitted in this system, the stability of these marriages must be exemplary, according to the anthropological surveys.  As these examples show, many qualities considered essential components of marriage in contemporary Western usage are anything but universal: sexual exclusivity, property exchange, even the intention to stay together for long. None of these are expected in many of the relationships evolutionary psychologists and anthropologists insist on calling marriage.  Now consider the confusion created by the words mate and mating. A mate sometimes refers to a sexual partner in a given copulation; other times, it refers to a partner in a recognized marriage, with whom children are raised and all sorts of behavioral and economic patterns are established. To mate with someone could mean to join together \u201ctill death do us part,\u201d or it could refer to nothing more than a quickie with \u201cJulio down by the schoolyard.\u201d When evolutionary psychologists tell us that men and women have different innate cognitive or emotional \u201cmodules,\u201d which determine their reactions to a mate\u2019s infidelity, we suppose that this refers to a mate in a long-term relationship.  But you never know. When we read, \u201cSex differences in humans\u2019 mate-selection criteria exist and persist because the mechanisms that mediate mate evaluation differ for men and women,\u201d and that \u201ca tendency to become sexually aroused by visual stimuli constitutes part of the mate-selection process in men,\u201d14 we scratch our heads, wondering whether this is a discussion of how people choose that special someone to introduce to Mom or merely the immediate, visceral response patterns heterosexual men often experience in the presence of an attractive woman. Given that men have shown these same response patterns in response to photographs, films, attractively attired mannequins, and a Noah\u2019s ark of farm animals\u2014none of which are available for marriage\u2014it seems that this language must refer to sexual attraction alone. But we\u2019re not really sure. At what point does a mate become a mate with whom to mate?  CHAPTER NINE  Paternity Certainty: The Crumbling Cornerstone of the Standard Narrative  According to anthropologist Robert Edgerton, the Marind-anim people of Melanesia believed:  Semen was essential to human growth and development. They also married quite young, and to assure the bride\u2019s fertility, she had to be filled with semen. On her wedding night, therefore, as many as ten members of her husband\u2019s lineage had sexual intercourse with the bride, and if there were more men than this in the lineage, they had intercourse with her the following night\u2026. A similar ritual was repeated at various intervals throughout a woman\u2019s life.1  Welcome to the family. Have you met my cousins?  Lest you think this a particularly unusual wedding celebration, it seems the ancestors of the Romans did something similar. Marriage was celebrated with a wedding orgy in which the husband\u2019s friends had intercourse with the bride, with witnesses standing by. Otto Kiefer, in his 1934 Sexual Life in Ancient Rome, explains that from the Roman perspective, \u201cNatural and physical laws are alien and even opposed to the marriage tie. Accordingly, the woman who is entering marriage must atone to Mother Nature for violating her, and go through a period of free prostitution, in which she purchases the chastity of marriage by preliminary unchastity.\u201d2  In many societies, such unchaste shenanigans continue well beyond the wedding night. The Kulina of Amazonia have a ritual known as the dutse\u2019e bani towi: the \u201corder to get meat.\u201d Don Pollock explains that the village women \u201cgo in a group from household to household at dawn, singing to the adult men in each house, \u2018ordering\u2019 them to go hunting. At each house, one or more women in the group step forward to bang on the house with a stick; they will serve as the sex partners of the men of the house that night, if they are successful in their hunt. Women in the group\u2026are not allowed to select their own husband.\u201d  What happens next is significant. Feigning reluctance, the men drag themselves from their hammocks and head off into the jungle, but before splitting up to hunt independently, they agree on a time and place outside the village to meet later, where they\u2019ll redistribute whatever they\u2019ve bagged, thus ensuring that every man returns to the village with meat, guaranteeing extra-pair sex for one and all. Yet another nail in the coffin of the standard narrative.  Pollock\u2019s description of the hunters\u2019 triumphal return is beyond improvement:  At the end of the day the men return in a group to the village, where the adult women form a large semicircle and sing erotically provocative songs to the men, asking for their \u2018meat.\u2019 The men drop their catch in a large pile in the middle of the semicircle, often hurling it down with dramatic gestures and smug smiles\u2026. After cooking the meat and eating, each woman retires with the man whom she selected as her partner for the sexual tryst. Kulina engage in this ritual with great humor and perform it regularly.3  We\u2019ll bet they do. Pollock kindly confirmed our hunch that the Kulina word for \u201cmeat\u201d (bani) refers both to food and to what you\u2019re thinking it does, dear reader. Maybe marriage isn\u2019t a human universal, but the capacity for sexual double entendre just might be.  Love, Lust, and Liberty at Lugu Lake  There is not now, and never has been, a society in which confidence in paternity is so low that men are typically more closely related genetically to their sisters\u2019 than to their wives\u2019 offspring. Happily promiscuous, nonpossessive, Rousseauian chimpanzees turned out not to exist; I am not convinced by the available evidence that such human beings exist either.  DONALD SYMONS, The Evolution of Human Sexuality  Symons\u2019s bold declaration was an expression of faith in parental investment theory and the central importance of paternity certainty in human evolution. But Symons was dead wrong on both points. As he wrote those ill-fated words in the late 1970s, primatologists in jungles along the Congo River were learning that bonobos are precisely the happily promiscuous and nonpossessive apes whose existence Symons declared impossible. And the Mosuo (pronounced MWO-swo\u2014also referred to as Na or Nari), an ancient society in southwest China, are a society where paternity certainty is so low and inconsequential that men do indeed raise their sisters\u2019 children as their own.  \u00a0  Women and men should not marry, for love is like the seasons\u2014it comes and goes.  YANG ERCHE NAMU (Mosuo woman)  In the mountains around Lugu Lake, near the border between China\u2019s Yunnan and Sichuan provinces, live about 56,000 people who enjoy a family system that has perplexed and fascinated travelers and scholars for centuries. The Mosuo revere Lugu Lake as the Mother Goddess, while the mountain towering over it, Ganmo, is respected as the Goddess of Love. Their language is rendered in Dongba, the sole pictographic language still used in the world today. They have no words for murder, war, or rape. The Mosuo\u2019s relaxed and respectful tranquility is accompanied by a nearly absolute sexual freedom and autonomy for both men and women.4  In 1265, Marco Polo passed through the Mosuo region and later recalled their unashamed sexuality, writing, \u201cThey do not consider it objectionable for a foreigner, or any other man, to have his way with their wives, daughters, sisters, or any other women in their home. They consider it a great benefit, in fact, saying that their gods and idols will be disposed in their favor and offer them material goods in great abundance. This is why they are so generous with their women toward foreigners.\u201d \u201cMany times,\u201d wrote Polo, with a wink and a nudge, \u201ca foreigner has wallowed in bed for three or four days with a poor sap\u2019s wife.\u201d5  Macho Italian that he was, Polo completely misread the situation. He misinterpreted the women\u2019s sexual availability as a commodity controlled by the men, when in fact, the most striking feature of the Mosuo system is the fiercely defended sexual autonomy of all adults, women as well as men.  The Mosuo refer to their arrangement as sese, meaning \u201cwalking.\u201d True to form, most anthropologists miss the point by referring to the Mosuo system as \u201cwalking marriage,\u201d and including the Mosuo on their all-encompassing lists of cultures that practice \u201cmarriage.\u201d The Mosuo themselves disagree with this depiction of their system. \u201cBy any stretch of the imagination, sese are not marriages,\u201d says Yang Erche Namu, a Mosuo woman who published a memoir about her childhood along the shores of Mother Lake. \u201cAll sese are of the visiting kind, and none involves the exchange of vows, property, the care of children, or expectations of fidelity.\u201d The Mosuo language has no word for husband or wife, preferring the word azhu, meaning \u201cfriend.\u201d6  The Mosuo are a matrilineal, agricultural people, passing property and family name from mother to daughter(s), so the household revolves around the women. When a girl reaches maturity at about thirteen or fourteen, she receives her own bedroom that opens both to the inner courtyard of the house and to the street through a private door. A Mosuo girl has complete autonomy as to who steps through this private door into her babahuago (flower room). The only strict rule is that her guest must be gone by sunrise. She can have a different lover the following night\u2014or later that same night\u2014if she chooses. There is no expectation of commitment, and any child she conceives is raised in her mother\u2019s house, with the help of the girl\u2019s brothers and the rest of the community.  Recalling her childhood, Yang Erche Namu echoes Malidoma Patrice Som\u00e9\u2019s description of his African childhood, explaining, \u201cWe children could roam at our own will and visit from house to house and village to village without our mothers\u2019 ever fearing for our safety. Every adult was responsible for every child, and every child in turn was respectful of every adult.\u201d7  Among the Mosuo, a man\u2019s sisters\u2019 children are considered his paternal responsibility\u2014not those who may (or may not) be the fruit of his own nocturnal visits to various flower rooms. Here we see another society in which male parental investment is unrelated to biological paternity. In the Mosuo language, the word Awu translates to both father and uncle. \u201cIn place of one father, Mosuo children have many uncles who take care of them. In a way,\u201d writes Yang Erche Namu, \u201cwe also have many mothers, because we call our aunts by the name azhe Ami, which means \u2018little mother.\u2019\u201d8  In a twist that should send many mainstream theorists into a tailspin, sexual relations are kept strictly separate from Mosuo family relations. At night, Mosuo men are expected to sleep with their lovers. If not, they sleep in one of the outer buildings, never in the main house with their sisters. Custom prohibits any talk of love or romantic relationships in the family home. Complete discretion is expected from everyone. While both men and women are free to do as they will, they\u2019re expected to respect one another\u2019s privacy. There\u2019s no kissing and telling at Lugu Lake.  The mechanics of the a\u00e7ia relationships, as they are referred to by Mosuo, are characterized by a sacred regard for each individual\u2019s autonomy\u2014whether man or woman.9 Cai Hua, a Chinese anthropologist and author of A Society without Fathers or Husbands, explains, \u201cNot only do men and women have the freedom to foster as many a\u00e7ia relationships as they want and to end them as they please, but each person can have simultaneous relationships with several a\u00e7ia, whether it be during one night or over a longer period.\u201d These relationships are discontinuous, lasting only as long as the two people are in each other\u2019s presence. \u201cEach visitor\u2019s departure from the woman\u2019s home is taken to be the end of their a\u00e7ia relationship,\u201d according to Cai Hua. \u201cThere is no concept of a\u00e7ia that applies to the future. The a\u00e7ia relationship\u2026only exists instantaneously and retrospectively,\u201d although a couple may repeat their visits as often as they wish.10  Particularly libidinous Mosuo women and men unashamedly report having had hundreds of relationships. Shame, from their perspective, would be the proper response to promises of or demands for fidelity. A vow of fidelity would be considered inappropriate\u2014an attempt at negotiation or exchange. Openly expressed jealousy, for the Mosuo, is considered aggressive in its implied intrusion upon the sacred autonomy of another person, and is thus met with ridicule and shame.  Sadly, hostility toward this free expression of female sexual autonomy is not limited to narrow-minded anthropologists and thirteenth-century Italian explorers. Although the Mosuo have no history of trying to export their system or convincing anyone else of the superiority of their approach to love and sex, they have long suffered outside pressure to abandon their traditional beliefs, which outsiders seem to find threatening.  Once the Chinese established full control of the area in 1956, government officials began making annual visits to lecture the people on the dangers of sexual freedom and convince them to switch to \u201cnormal\u201d marriage. In a bit of dubious publicity reminiscent of Reefer Madness, Chinese government officials showed up one year with a portable generator and a film showing \u201cactors dressed as Mosuo\u2026who were in the last stages of syphilis, who had gone mad and lost most of their faces.\u201d The audience response was not what the Chinese officials expected: their makeshift cinema was burned to the ground. But the officials didn\u2019t give up. Yang Erche Namu recalls \u201cmeetings night after night where they harangued and criticized and interrogated\u2026. [The Chinese officials] ambushed men on their way to their lovers\u2019 houses, they dragged couples out of their beds and exposed people naked to their own relatives\u2019 eyes.\u201d  When even these heavy-handed tactics failed to convince the Mosuo to abandon their system, government officials insisted on bringing (if not demonstrating) \u201cdecency\u201d to the Mosuo. They cut off essential deliveries of seed grain and children\u2019s clothing. Finally, literally starved into submission, many Mosuo agreed to participate in government-sponsored marriage ceremonies, where each was given \u201ca cup of tea, a cigarette, pieces of candy, and a paper certificate.\u201d11  But the arm-twisting had little lasting effect. Travel writer Cynthia Barnes visited Lugu Lake in 2006 and found the Mosuo system still intact, though under pressure from Chinese tourists who, like Marco Polo 750 years earlier, mistake the sexual autonomy of Mosuo women for licentiousness. \u201cAlthough their lack of coyness draws the world\u2019s attention to the Mosuo,\u201d Barnes writes, \u201csex is not the center of their universe.\u201d She continues:  I think of my parents\u2019 bitter divorce, of childhood friends uprooted and destroyed because Mommy or Daddy decided to sleep with someone else. Lugu Lake, I think, is not so much a kingdom of women as a kingdom of family\u2014albeit one blessedly free of politicians and preachers extolling \u201cfamily values.\u201d There\u2019s no such thing as a \u201cbroken home,\u201d no sociologists wringing their hands over \u201csingle mothers,\u201d no economic devastation or shame and stigma when parents part. Sassy and confident, [a Mosuo girl will] grow up cherished in a circle of male and female relatives\u2026. When she joins the dances and invites a boy into her flower room, it will be for love, or lust, or whatever people call it when they are operating on hormones and heavy breathing. She will not need that boy\u2014or any other\u2014to have a home, to make a \u201cfamily.\u201d She already knows that she will always have both.12  The Mosuo approach to love and sex may well finally be destroyed by the hordes of Han Chinese tourists who threaten to turn Lugu Lake into a theme-park version of Mosuo culture. But the Mosuo\u2019s persistence in the face of decades\u2014if not centuries\u2014of extreme pressure to conform to what many scientists still insist is human nature stands as a proud, undeniable counter-example to the standard narrative.    Mosuo woman (Photo: Jim Goodman)    Mosuo women (Photo: Sachi Cunningham/www.germancamera.com)  On the Inevitability of Patriarchy  Despite societies like the Mosuo\u2019s in which women are autonomous and play crucial roles in maintaining social and economic stability, and plentiful evidence from dozens of foraging societies in which females enjoy high status and respect, many scientists rigidly insist that all societies are and always have been patriarchal. In Why Men Rule (originally titled The Inevitability of Patriarchy), sociologist Steven Goldberg provides an example of this absolutist view, writing, \u201cPatriarchy is universal\u2026. Indeed, of all social institutions there is probably none whose universality is so totally agreed upon\u2026. There is not, nor has there ever been, any society that even remotely failed to associate authority and leadership in suprafamilial areas with the male. There are no borderline cases.\u201d13 Strong words. Yet, in 247 pages, Goldberg fails to mention the Mosuo even once.  Goldberg does mention the Minangkabau of West Sumatra, Indonesia, but only in an appendix, where he cites two passages from others\u2019 research. The first, dating to 1934, says that men are generally served food before women. From this, Goldberg concludes that males wield superior power in Minangkabau society. This is as logically consistent as concluding that Western societies must be matriarchal because men often hold doors open for women, allowing them to pass first. The second passage Goldberg cites is from a paper co-authored by anthropologist Peggy Reeves Sanday, suggesting that the Minangkabau men have some degree of authority in the application of various aspects of traditional law.    Minangkabau woman and girls (Photo: Christopher Ryan)14  There are two big problems with Goldberg\u2019s application of Sanday\u2019s work. First, there is no inherent contradiction between claiming that a society is not patriarchal and yet that men do enjoy various types of authority. This is simply illogical: Van Gogh\u2019s famous painting The Starry Night is not a \u201cyellow painting,\u201d though there is plenty of yellow in it. The second problem with this citation is that Peggy Reeves Sanday, the anthropologist Goldberg cites, has consistently argued that the Minangkabau are matriarchal. In fact, her most recent book about the Minangkabau is called Women at the Center: Life in a Modern Matriarchy.15  Having spent over twenty summers living among the Minangkabau, Sanday says, \u201cThe power of Minangkabau women extends to the economic and social realms,\u201d noting, for example, that women control land inheritance and that a husband typically moves into the wife\u2019s household. The four million Minangkabau living in West Sumatra consider themselves to be a matriarchal society. \u201cWhile we in the West glorify male dominance and competition,\u201d Sanday says, \u201cthe Minangkabau glorify their mythical Queen Mother and cooperation.\u201d She reports that \u201cmales and females relate more like partners for the common good than like competitors ruled by egocentric self-interest,\u201d and that as with bonobo social groups, women\u2019s prestige increases with age and \u201caccrues to those who promote good relations\u2026.\u201d16  As happens so often in trying to understand and discuss other cultures, wording trips up specialists. When they claim never to have found a \u201ctrue matriarchy,\u201d these anthropologists are envisioning a mirror image of patriarchy, a vision that ignores the differing ways males and females conceptualize and wield power. Sanday says that among the Minangkabau, for example, \u201cNeither male nor female rule is possible because of [their] belief that decision-making should be by consensus.\u201d When she kept asking people which sex ruled, she was finally told that she was asking the wrong question. \u201cNeither sex rules\u2026because males and females complement one another.\u201d17  Remember this when some loudmouth at the bar declares that \u201cpatriarchy is universal, and always has been!\u201d It\u2019s not, and it hasn\u2019t. But rather than feel threatened, we\u2019d recommend that our male readers ponder this: Societies in which women have lots of autonomy and authority tend to be decidedly male-friendly, relaxed, tolerant, and plenty sexy. Got that, fellas? If you\u2019re unhappy at the amount of sexual opportunity in your life, don\u2019t blame the women. Instead, make sure they have equal access to power, wealth, and status. Then watch what happens.  As with bonobos, where female coalitions are the ultimate social authority and individual females need not fear the larger males, human societies in which women are \u201csassy and confident,\u201d as Barnes described the Mosuo girls\u2014free to express their minds and sexuality without fear of shame or persecution\u2014tend to be far more comfortable places for most men than societies ruled by a male elite. Maybe matriarchal societies are so difficult for Western male anthropologists to recognize because they expect a culture where men are suffering under the high heels of women\u2014a reverse reflection of the long-standing male oppression of women in Western cultures. Instead, observing a society where most of the men are lounging about relaxed and happy, they conclude they\u2019ve found yet another patriarchy, thereby missing the point entirely.  The March of the Monogamous  The idea of monogamy hasn\u2019t so much been tried and found wanting, as found difficult and left untried.  G. K. CHESTERTON  The surprise box-office hit of 2005 was a film called March of the Penguins. The second-biggest money-making documentary to date, viewers were touched by its depiction of the extreme dedication penguin couples showed in nurturing their adorable penguin chicks. Many viewers saw their own marriages reflected in the penguins\u2019 sacrifice for their offspring and for each other. As one reviewer put it, \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to watch the thousands of penguins huddled together against the icy Antarctic blasts\u2026without feeling a tug of anthropomorphic kinship.\u201d Churches across the United States reserved cinemas for private screenings for their congregations. Rich Lowry, editor of The National Review, told a conference of young Republicans, \u201cPenguins are the really ideal example of monogamy. The dedication of these birds is amazing.\u201d Adam Leipzig, president of National Geographic Feature Films, declared the penguins \u201cmodel parents,\u201d continuing, \u201cWhat they go through to look after their children is phenomenal, and no parent who sees it will ever complain about the school run. There are parallels with human nature and it\u2019s moving to see.\u201d18  But unlike the birds themselves, penguin sexuality is not all black and white. That perfect penguin pair, that \u201cideal example of monogamy,\u201d those \u201cmodel parents\u201d are monogamous only as long as it takes to get their little one out of the egg, off the ice, and into the frigid Antarctic water\u2014a little less than a year. If you\u2019ve seen the film, you know that with all the trekking back and forth across the windswept ice and huddling against raging Antarctic blizzards, there\u2019s not much in the way of extramarital temptation anyway. Once Junior is swimming with the other eleven-month-olds\u2014the penguin equivalent of kindergarten\u2014fidelity is quickly forgotten, divorce is quick, automatic, and painless, and Mom and Dad are back on the penguin prowl. With a breeding adult typically living thirty years or more, these \u201cmodel parents\u201d have at least two dozen \u201cfamilies\u201d in a lifetime. Did someone say \u201cideal example of monogamy\u201d?  Whether you found the film to be cloyingly sweet or refreshingly so, a bold, if somewhat perverse, double feature would pair The March of the Penguins with Werner Herzog\u2019s Encounters at the End of the World. Herzog\u2019s documentary of the Antarctic is a masterpiece of photography and interviews with a range of surprising characters, including Dr. David Ainley, an almost comically reserved marine ecologist who has been studying penguins in Antarctica for two decades. Under Herzog\u2019s wry questioning, Ainley reports having witnessed cases of penguin m\u00e9nages-\u00e0-trois, in which two males take turns caring for a particular female\u2019s egg, as well as \u201cpenguin prostitution,\u201d where females receive prime nest-building pebbles in exchange for a bit of penguin poontang.  The prairie vole is another supposed paragon of \u201cnatural monogamy.\u201d According to one newspaper article, \u201cPrairie voles\u2014squat rodents indigenous to plains and grasslands\u2014are considered to be a near-perfect monogamous species. They form pair bonds that share a nest. Both male and female actively protect each other, their territory, and their young. The male is an active parent and, if one of the pair dies, the survivor does not take a new mate.\u201d19 Considering the vitriol Darwin faced 150 years ago when he dared compare humans to apes, it\u2019s striking to note the scraps of comfort contemporary scientists find in equating human sexual behavior with that of the ratlike prairie vole. We who once compared ourselves to angels now see ourselves reflected in this lowly rodent. But C. Sue Carter and Lowell L. Getz, who have studied the biology of monogamy in prairie voles and other species for thirty-five years, are unambiguous: \u201cSexual exclusivity,\u201d they write \u201cis not a feature of [the vole\u2019s] monogamy.\u201d20 Thomas Insel, director of the National Institute of Mental Health (formerly director of Yerkes Primate Center) and an expert on the prairie vole, says that those in the know have a less exalted view of the prairie vole\u2019s monogamy: \u201cThey\u2019ll sleep with anyone but they\u2019ll only sit by their partners.\u201d21  Then there\u2019s that line (invariably directed at women, for some reason) that goes, \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for monogamy, marry a swan.\u201d*  So what about swans, then? Many species of birds have long been believed to be monogamous because two parents are needed for the 24/7 labor of incubating eggs and feeding nestlings. As with humans, investment-minded theorists assumed males would help out only if they were certain the young were their own. But the recent advent of affordable DNA testing has blown embarrassing holes in this story, too. Although a pair of bluebirds may build a nest and rear the young together, an average of 15 to 20 percent of the chicks are not sired by the male in the partnership, according to Patricia Adair Gowaty, a behavioral ecologist. And bluebirds aren\u2019t particularly slutty songbirds: DNA studies of the chicks of some 180 bird species previously thought to be monogamous have shown that about 90 percent of them aren\u2019t. Swans, alas, are not among the virtuous 10 percent. So if you\u2019re looking for monogamy, forget the swan, too!  \u00a0  Is monogamy natural? Yes\u2026. Human beings almost never have to be cajoled into pairing. Instead, we do this naturally. We flirt. We feel infatuation. We fall in love. We marry. And the vast majority of us marry only one person at a time. Pair-bonding is a trademark of the human animal.  HELEN FISHER  Strange trademark for a species that enjoys so much extra-pair sexual activity. The glue holding the standard narrative together is the assumption that to marry and to mate have universally applicable meanings, like the verbs to eat, or to give birth. But whatever terminology we use for the socially approved special relationship that often exists between men and women around the world will never communicate the universe of variations our species comes up with.  \u201cMarriage,\u201d \u201cmating,\u201d and \u201clove\u201d are socially constructed phenomena that have little or no transferable meaning outside any given culture. The examples we\u2019ve noted of rampant ritualized group sex, mate-swapping, unrestrained casual affairs, and socially sanctioned sequential sex were all reported in cultures that anthropologists insist are monogamous simply because they\u2019ve determined that something they call \u201cmarriage\u201d takes place there. No wonder so many insist that marriage, monogamy, and the nuclear family are human universals. With such all-encompassing interpretations of the concepts, even the prairie vole, who \u201csleeps with anyone,\u201d would qualify.]]  **1.

DON'T DO ANY CODING OR SEARCHING, JUST WRITE IN THE CHAT."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The text examines misunderstandings and complexities surrounding marriage, love, and lust by exploring how these concepts are perceived in various cultures and academic discourses. Here is a synthesis of the key points distilled for maximum informational value:\n\n**Core Assertions and Definitions:**\n1. **Marriage and Monogamy Misunderstandings:**\n   - Marriage is often seen as a universal institution and a key to human happiness, but its definitions and expectations vary greatly across cultures.\n   - Love and lust are commonly conflated, though they are distinct; love involves deep affection and attachment, while lust is based on sexual desire.\n\n2. **Evolutionary Psychology Interpretation:**\n   - The field seeks to identify universal human behaviors, yet often fails due to biases and societal influences clouding genuine research with cultural assumptions.\n   - There\u2019s a tendency to equate mating with marriage without acknowledging the vast diversity in human sexual and relational patterns.\n\n3. **Conceptual Models:**\n   - Terms like \u201cmarriage\u201d and \u201cmonogamy\u201d are often imbued with Western bias, leading to inaccurate applications to non-Western societies.\n   - Pair-bonding is frequently cited as a human universal condition, but interpretations often overlook societies that function with different family structures and mating practices.\n\n4. **Cultural Examples and Their Implications:**\n   - Mosuo society emphasizes female autonomy in sexual relationships, challenging assumptions about the necessity of paternity certainty.\n   - The !Kung San, Ach\u00e9, Siriono, and other societies have marital practices that don\u2019t conform to the Western idea of permanent, exclusive pair-bonds.\n\n5. **Sources and Credibility:**\n   - Academic explorations, like those of Frans de Waal on primate bonds or Joan Roughgarden on sexual selection, reveal biases in interpreting animal and human mating systems.\n   - Misapplications of language, such as equating avian pair-bonding with human marriage, obscure the complexity of social structures.\n\n6. **Challenges to the Standard Narrative:**\n   - Examples from diverse societies demonstrate that concepts like paternity certainty and sexual exclusivity are not as universal as previously believed.\n   - Constructs like \u201cpatriarchy\u201d and \u201cmatriarchy\u201d are not applied consistently or appropriately, leading to misunderstandings about gender relations and power dynamics.\n\n**Procedural and Explanatory Points:**\n1. **Navigating Cultural Diversity:**\n   - Researchers need a clear understanding of local contexts and definitions when studying family structures and mating systems.\n   - Domains like anthropology must refine terminologies to accurately represent the observed social phenomena without bias.\n\n2. **Role of Language in Misinterpretation:**\n   - Language limitations and translation issues often complicate discussions of marriage and sexuality across cultures.\n   - Anthropologists must adopt precise language that accurately captures the essence of the relationships they study.\n\n**Transformative Claims:**\n1. **Reframing Human Universals:**\n   - The idea that certain structures like nuclear families or monogamous pair-bonds are universal is often a reflection of cultural bias rather than evolutionary necessity.\n   - Recognizing diverse arrangements opens the potential for redefining acceptable relational models.\n\n2. **Implications for Understanding Human Nature:**\n   - Recognizing the variety in human mating and marriage patterns challenges the Western-centric view, urging a broader perspective on what constitutes natural human behavior.\n\n**Structural Importance and Transitions:**\n1. **Clear Synthesis:**\n   - The passage uses examples from a wide range of cultures to disrupt the notion of universality in human marital practices and demonstrates the influence of cultural context on scholarly interpretation.\n   \n2. **Conclusion Reflection:**\n   - Societies with empowered women often exhibit egalitarian and harmonious relations, suggesting that power dynamics are crucial to understanding human social structures.\n\nIn essence, the passage critiques the simplicity with which marriage and monogamous bonding are often viewed while highlighting the considerable variation in human relational dynamics. It emphasizes the need to redefine these concepts by considering a wider array of human experiences, moving beyond a narrow evolutionary psychology lens, and instead embracing the complexity and diversity inherent in human societies."}]}
