The Guardian article asserts that eliminating the de-minimis rule corrects a competitive imbalance favoring fast fashion retailers such as Shein and Temu. However, from an intermediate microeconomic standpoint, this intervention raises important questions regarding market efficiency, consumer welfare, and unintended distortions.

Firstly, the effectiveness of tariffs as corrective measures depends fundamentally on whether a genuine market failure exists. The article presupposes unfair competition arising from tax advantages without adequately analyzing if such asymmetry truly constitutes market distortion. Indeed, introducing tariffs creates a price wedge and consequently a deadweight loss (DWL), reducing allocative efficiency (Module 14). Given the documented high price elasticity for fast fashion goods (Andrews and Benzing, 2010), the economic incidence of tariffs likely falls heavily on consumers rather than producers, disproportionately affecting lower-income individuals dependent on affordable clothing.

Further complicating the article's claims, empirical studies by Miravete (2024) indicate that uniform price constraints—comparable to tariffs enforcing uniform cost increases—often reduce overall welfare and output compared to flexible pricing models. This suggests that imposing tariffs may unintentionally diminish consumer welfare more broadly, undermining rather than supporting fairness objectives.

Additionally, operational adaptability within firms is a critical consideration overlooked in the original article. Fares et al. (2018) demonstrate that retailers often respond to cost pressures by optimising inventory management and supply-chain responsiveness, potentially offsetting tariff impacts without substantially changing their business practices. Such firm-level strategies imply tariffs alone may fail to shift consumer behaviors towards sustainable options like resale platforms, contrary to the article’s optimistic claims.

Finally, theoretical insights from Aviv et al. (2019) highlight strategic consumer behaviors, such as delaying purchases in anticipation of price fluctuations, complicating simplistic assumptions about direct demand responses. The implication here is that tariffs may not straightforwardly achieve intended consumption reductions or sustainability goals but could instead induce complex, unpredictable market dynamics.

In sum, while the removal of the de-minimis rule seeks fairness in market competition, economic theory and empirical evidence suggest it is likely to introduce inefficiencies and unintended distortions. More targeted, precise interventions directly addressing specific market failures, such as environmental externalities, would be preferable to generalized tariff measures with uncertain welfare outcomes.
